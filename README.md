# Voice Actor Scanner

Ever watched an anime and someone's voice actor sounds really familiar? This tool tells you what other animes an voice actor has been in based on your MyAnimeList!

This uses Selenium, so you will need to download a chromedriver corresponding to your Google Chrome version and putting that in the same directory as `run.py`
